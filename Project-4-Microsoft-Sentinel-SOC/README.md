# Project 4 — Microsoft Sentinel Security Monitoring & Incident Response

## Duration
2024 – 2025

## Objective
Demonstrate hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring, detection, and incident response using Microsoft Sentinel integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM & SOAR)
- Microsoft 365 Defender
- Azure Log Analytics
- KQL (Kusto Query Language)

## Environment Setup
- Deployed Microsoft Sentinel in an Azure environment
- Integrated Microsoft 365 Defender as a primary data source
- Onboarded log sources for real-time security monitoring

## Detection & Automation
- Created custom KQL analytic rules to detect:
  - Phishing attempts
  - Malware activity
  - Suspicious access and sign-in anomalies
- Built SOAR playbooks to automate alert response and incident handling

## SOC Activities Performed
- Monitored and triaged security incidents in Sentinel
- Conducted threat hunting using KQL queries
- Performed UEBA analysis to identify risky user behavior
- Simulated attack scenarios to validate detections and response workflows

## Reporting & Dashboards
- Created Sentinel dashboards to visualize security events
- Generated incident reports documenting findings, impact, and response actions

## Outcome
Improved visibility into security events, reduced manual response effort through automation, and strengthened SOC detection and response capabilities.
