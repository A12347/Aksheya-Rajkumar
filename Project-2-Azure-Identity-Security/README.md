Project 2 — Azure Identity Security (Conditional Access + MFA)

## Objective
Reduce account compromise risk by blocking legacy authentication and enforcing MFA.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Conditional Access
- MFA

## Problem
Legacy authentication protocols and weak authentication increase account takeover risk.

## Solution
- Proposed Conditional Access policies to block legacy authentication
- Enforced MFA for targeted users/groups
- Documented policy intent and expected impact

## Outcome
Improved identity security posture and reduced risky authentication pathways.
